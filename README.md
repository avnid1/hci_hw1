I used ChatGPT to teach me about span for grid options, position relative vs. absolute for elements, and it helped me validate my division of elements on my screen.  
I also used ChatGPT to generate line 1 of my code in styles.css (* { box-sizing: border-box; }), which I used so that my elements wouldn't overflow on the screen, primarily for width calculations.  
Lastly, I used ChatGPT to generate lines 126-132 of my code in styles.css, which helped me with my grid display for #sortOptions. I then went back and rewrote the code to ensure my understanding of the material.  
Ultimately, all code was reviewed and finalized by me.
